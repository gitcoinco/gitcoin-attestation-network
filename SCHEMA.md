# Donation Attestation Schema

The schema captures a snapshot of the checkout of all donations made to projects taking part across rounds across chains on allo protocol.
The schema is generated by a gitcoin backend server and then the donor signs the delegated attesation onto an EAS supported chain

This schema works across any EAS-supported blockchain network, making it future-proof. Attestations are network-agnostic, so as Gitcoin expands to more chains, an aggregator can easily gather them across networks.

### Schema Details

```json
{
    "roundIds"          : "(uint64,uint64)[]", // array of tuple(chainId, roundId)
    "totalUSDAmount"    : "uint64", // total contribution
    "timestamp"         : "uint64", // time of donation
    "metadataPtr"       : "string", // Link to details about contribution (eg: IPFS)
}
```

Note: 
- `donor` can be obtained from `attesation.recipient`
- `refUID` would be used to chain/link all your attestation
