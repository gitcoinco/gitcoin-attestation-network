# Donation Attestation Schema

The schema captures a snapshot of the checkout of all donations made to projects taking part across rounds across chains on allo protocol.
The schema is generated by a gitcoin backend server and then the donor signs the delegated attesation onto an EAS supported chain

This schema works across any EAS-supported blockchain network, making it future-proof. Attestations are network-agnostic, so as Gitcoin expands to more chains, an aggregator can easily gather them across networks.

### Schema Details

```javascript
{
    "projectsContributed"   : "uint64" // networks where the round reside
    "roundsContributed"     : "uint64", // rounds contributed to
    "chainIdsContributed"   : "uint64", // chainIds contributed to
    "totalUSDAmount"        : "uint128", // total contribution
    "timestamp"             : "uint64", // time of donation
    "metadataPtr"           : "string", // Link to details about contribution (eg: IPFS)
}
```

Note: 
- `donor` can be obtained from `attesation.recipient`
- `refUID` would be used to chain/link all your attestation

- ### MetadataPtr

```javascript
[
    {
        "chainId" : number,
        "roundId" : number,
        "txnHash" : string,
        "projects": [
            "id"           : string, // registry profile id 
            "anchor"       : string, // registry profile anchor
            "applicationId": string, // round's application id
            "amountInUSD"  : bigint, // total usd amount
            "amount"       : bigint, // total tokens
            "token"        : string  // token address  
        ]
    }
]
```
